# 👋 I'm Luke!

I'm an undergraduate student of Mathematics and Computer Science at West Virginia University. I'm passionate about combinatorics and graph theory and their applications to algorithms and complexity. My focus is on Extremal Graph Theory and Graph Algorithms, and I’m eager to learn new technologies, improve my skills, and collaborate with others.
